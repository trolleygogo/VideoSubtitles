1
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:04,805
All right.

2
00:00:04,805 --> 00:00:06,765
The proper way to cut an orange. Okay.

3
00:00:06,785 --> 00:00:09,045
You see here is the top of the orange,

4
00:00:09,185 --> 00:00:10,445
so we're gonna put that sideways.

5
00:00:11,665 --> 00:00:15,685
So we'll just cut off the bottom. Cut off the top. Okay.
